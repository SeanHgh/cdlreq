title: Tamper-Proof Audit Log Storage
description: Implementation of immutable audit log storage system with cryptographic integrity verification to prevent tampering.
related_requirements:
  - REQ-AUD-001
implementation_unit: src/audit/secure_storage.py
unit_test: tests/audit/test_secure_storage.py
test_criteria:
  - Test immutable log storage with blockchain-like integrity
  - Test cryptographic hash verification of log entries
  - Test log compression and archival processes
  - Test recovery and verification of archived logs
  - Test performance of integrity verification operations
design_notes: "Implements write-once storage with cryptographic hashing. Uses Merkle tree structure for efficient integrity verification. Supports both local and cloud-based storage backends."
